<h2>Five Natural Hybrid Combinations<br />in Minnows (Cyprinidae)</h2>

<h4>BY<br />FRANK B. CROSS AND W. L. MINCKLEY</h4>

<p>The hybrid fishes described herein are <i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i>
(Rafinesque) &times; <i>Notropis cornutus frontalis</i> (Agassiz), <i>C. erythrogaster</i>
&times; <i>Semotilus atromaculatus</i> (Mitchill), <i>Campostoma
anomalum plumbeum</i> (Girard) &times; <i>S. atromaculatus</i>, <i>Gila nigrescens</i>
(Girard) &times; <i>Rhinichthys cataractae</i> (Valenciennes), and <i>Notropis
venustus venustus</i> (Girard) &times; <i>Notropis whipplei</i> (Girard). Two
of the combinations have been reported, without descriptions, in
literature (citations below), and Hubbs (1955: Fig. 3) graphically
indicated hybridization between the same genera with which this
paper is concerned, but did not designate the species involved.</p>

<p>All specimens of <i>C. erythrogaster</i> &times; <i>N. c. frontalis</i>, <i>C. erythrogaster</i>
&times; <i>S. atromaculatus</i>, <i>C. a. plumbeum</i> &times; <i>S. atromaculatus</i>,
and <i>N. v. venustus</i> &times; <i>N. whipplei</i> were taken in a period of
severe drought in Kansas and Arkansas. All were from small,
spring-fed streams that support large populations of fishes. That
the drought of 1953-1956 had pronounced effects on stream habitats
in Kansas has been documented by Minckley and Cross (1959).
Satisfactory sites for spawning may have been few, but an abundance
of adult fishes persisted from earlier, wet years. Unusual
crowding of spawning fishes would increase the opportunity for
fertilization of the eggs of one species by sperm from another
species. We think that the hybrids reported here (excepting <i>G.
nigrescens</i> &times; <i>R. cataractae</i>) are explainable on the basis of crowding;
we have no information about stream-conditions where the
last-named hybrid was found. Generally, hybridization of fishes
seems most common in areas that have been subject to radical
climatic change in the past 20,000 or fewer years (Hubbs, 1955:18-19),
and in streams that have been altered recently by the
activities of man (Hubbs and Strawn, 1956:342, and others).
Streams from which we report hybrids probably were affected
by overgrazing of their watersheds; overgrazing was unusually
severe in the drought.</p>

<p>Most of the hybrids were recognized as unusual at the time
of capture, and were saved as part of numerically selective samples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
from the streams (rather than being discovered in the laboratory,
in random samples).</p>

<p>Our measurements were made by methods defined by Hubbs
and Lagler (1958); values are expressed as thousandths of the
larger dimension.</p>

<p><b><i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i> &times; <i>Notropis cornutus frontalis</i></b>: KU 3872
(26.7 mm. in standard length) and KU 4170 (46.6 mm.) from
Deep Creek, Riley Co., Kansas, Sec. 23, T. 11S, R. 7E, Dec. 14,
1957, and Apr. 26, 1958, respectively; and KU 4185 (39.3 mm.)
from Bluff Creek, Pottawatomie Co., Kansas, Sec. 15, T. 6S, R.
8E, June 29, 1958. Compared in Table 1 with five specimens of
<i>C. erythrogaster</i>, KU 3914 (39.3 to 47.3 mm., mean 43.0 mm.)
from the same locality and of the same date as KU 3872 (above);
and with five specimens of <i>N. c. frontalis</i>, KU 4184 (41.0 to 46.5
mm., mean 42.5 mm.) from the same locality and of the same date
as KU 4185 (above). This cross has previously been recorded
by Trautman (1957:326, 355) and by Minckley (1959:431).</p>

<p>The head-lengths of the hybrids are greater than in specimens
of like size of <i>C. erythrogaster</i> or <i>N. c. frontalis</i> (Table 1). Hubbs
and Miller (1943:373-374) reported that hybrids of <i>Gila orcutti</i>
&times; <i>Siphateles mohavensis</i> have larger, more robust heads than either
of the parental species, perhaps because of heterosis. The enlarged
heads in hybrids of <i>C. erythrogaster</i> and <i>N. c. frontalis</i> result primarily
from elongation of the postorbital region, with lesser elongation
of the snout and orbit. The enlarged head affects measurements
obtained for other structures that are parts of the head
(and expressed as proportions of standard length or head-length),
causing a tendency toward <i>N. c. frontalis</i> when the head-part is
divided by standard length, and greater intermediacy or a tendency
toward <i>C. erythrogaster</i> when the head-part is divided by head-length.
In characters in which the parental species differ most
(size of eye, length of upper jaw, and width of gape), the hybrids
are intermediate between the parental species, regardless of
whether the measurements are expressed as proportions of head-length
or standard length; however, tendencies toward one or
the other of the parental species (dependent on the divisor) can
also been seen in these characters. Some experimentally propagated
hybrids show highly variable, and sometimes extreme
characters, rather than intermediacy of meristic and proportional
characters (Hubbs, 1956).</p>

In pigmentation, all three of the hybrids are intermediate between
the parental species. The mid-lateral band (which is dark
and discrete in <i>C. erythrogaster</i>, but faint, broad, and diffuse in
<i>N. c. frontalis</i>) is broader and fainter in the hybrids than in <i>Chrosomus</i>,
but is better developed than in <i>N. c. frontalis</i>. The dorsolateral
dark band of <i>C. erythrogaster</i> is present in the hybrids, but
is less distinct than in that species, and less distinct than the mid-lateral
band of the hybrids themselves. The dorsolateral band
is not present in <i>N. c. frontalis</i>. The color of the peritoneum in
the hybrids is the glossy, jet-black of <i>C. erythrogaster</i> in two specimens,
and the dusky-black of <i>N. c. frontalis</i> in one.</p>

<p><i>Chrosomus</i> and <i>Notropis</i> differ greatly in the length and convolution
of the intestine. <i>Chrosomus</i> has a long, coiled gut, which
is crossed by the mid-ventral line eight or nine times; in <i>N. c.
frontalis</i>, the intestine forms a flat, S-shaped loop that does not
cross the mid-ventral line. In the two largest hybrids (KU 4170
and 4185), the gut is intermediate, crossing the mid-ventral line
four times. In the smaller hybrid (KU 3872) the gut crosses the
mid-ventral line twice but the configuration of the anterior loops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
indicates that the same intestinal convolutions that were found
in the larger specimens would have developed in KU 3872 as the
gut elongated with increase in size of the fish.</p>

<p>Both Deep and Bluff creeks are clear, gravel-bottomed streams
draining parts of the Flint Hills Area of Kansas. A description of
Flint Hills streams and lists of fishes occurring in them have been
published by Minckley (1956 and 1959), and by Minckley and
Cross (1959).</p>

2 with five specimens of <i>C. erythrogaster</i>, KU 2836 (27.2 to 31.0
mm., mean 28.5) from the same locality and of the same date as
KU 2947 (above); and with five specimens of <i>S. atromaculatus</i>,
KU 1954, 2499, 2703, and 2838 (25.5 to 31.1 mm., mean 28.9 mm.)
from streams in the same area.</p>

<p>This hybrid is intermediate between the two species in number
of scales and pharyngeal teeth, and has a composite of the pigmentation
found in the parental fishes (Table 2). For diagnostic
purposes, greater importance is attached to the characters mentioned
above than to proportional measurements, which are subject
to considerable error because of the small size of the specimens.
The few measurements that were taken indicate that this
hybrid, like <i>C. erythrogaster</i> &times; <i>N. c. frontalis</i>, has a larger head
than do specimens of like size of either parental species. The enlarged
head affects measurements obtained for other structures
that are parts of the head; only the length of the upper jaw,
which is greatly different in the parental species, is actually
intermediate in KU 2947.</p>

<p>Mill Creek is a clear stream, similar to Deep and Bluff creeks
but somewhat larger. Mill Creek had an exceptionally large
population of fishes at the time the hybrid was found, but <i>Chrosomus</i>
and <i>Semotilus</i> were neither unusually common nor rare.</p>

<p>Two other crosses, both of which have been described in the
literature, also have been found in Mill Creek. These are <i>N. c.
frontalis</i> &times; <i>S. atromaculatus</i>, and <i>N. c. frontalis</i> &times; <i>Notropis rubellus</i>
(Agassiz).</p>

<p>The hybrids seem uniformly intermediate between the parental
species. Application of the hybrid index to the characters listed
in Table 3 results in a value of 55.7 when <i>C. a. plumbeum</i> is assigned
the value 0.</p>

<p>The pharyngeal arches of the hybrids are peculiarly deformed.
Expressed in terms of the one-or two-rowed arrangement common
to all North American cyprinids, tooth-counts of 0,5-4,1; 1,3(?)-4,0;
and 2,5-4,1 best fit the three fish. However, one arch bears only
three teeth, all deformed and badly aligned, plus a pit that presumably
represents a lost fourth tooth. At the other extreme,
one arch bears eight teeth, some of which are attached to the
arch between and behind others that are countable as part of the
basic main row. Supernumerary teeth and other deformities may
have resulted from abnormalities in the replacement process. In
some cases, replacement teeth probably failed to develop; in
others, replacement teeth seemingly developed, but attached to
the arch in abnormal positions, with or without loss of previous
teeth, causing irregularity in alignment. Hubbs (1951) described
an irregular (seemingly three-rowed) alignment in a fish that
Hay (1888:249) reported from western Kansas as <i>Squalius elongatus</i>.
However, Hubbs considered the specimen to be an aberrant
example of <i>S. atromaculatus</i>, and the characteristics that he lists
for it do not correspond closely with those of the hybrid specimens
that we have. Evans and Deubler (1955:32) found three
rows of teeth in two of 150 specimens of <i>Semotilus</i>, and attributed
the abnormality to failure of old teeth to fall out after formation
of new teeth. The teeth of <i>Campostoma</i> usually number 0,4-4,0,
and those of <i>Semotilus</i> 2,5-4,2. The pharyngeal arches are much
smaller in <i>Campostoma</i> than in <i>Semotilus</i>.</p>

<p>The peritoneum is mottled dark and silvery in the hybrids; it
has a composite of the coloration in the parental species rather
than a blended shade. The intestine has two diagonal loops crossing
the ventral part of the body cavity, and the hindgut lies high
in the cavity, along the left side of the air bladder. In <i>Campostoma</i>,
the long gut is transversely coiled around the air bladder, whereas
in <i>Semotilus</i> the gut forms a longitudinal, flattened, S-shaped loop,
ventral to the air bladder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>In the hybrids, the mouth is slightly oblique and nearly terminal.
The lower lip is thick and fleshy, but has only a suggestion of the
projecting mandibular shelf that is unique in <i>Campostoma</i>. The
upper lip is uniform in width, not medially expanded as in <i>S.
atromaculatus</i>. One of the hybrids lacks barbels, one has a
<i>Semotilus</i>-like barbel on the right side only, and one has a vestigial
barbel on the right side and an anomalous barbel that is nearly
terminal on the left upper lip.</p>

<p>In coloration, the hybrids lack the spot in the anterior base of the
dorsal fin that is characteristic of <i>Semotilus</i>, but each has a poorly-developed
dark lateral band, and a weak basicaudal spot. This
band and spot are usually prominently developed in <i>S. atromaculatus</i>
and usually are absent in adults of <i>C. a. plumbeum</i>.</p>

<p>In the position and obliquity of the mouth, basic color pattern
(diffuse lateral band and basicaudal spot), and the presence in one
specimen of a nearly terminal, barbel-like structure, the hybrids
somewhat resemble <i>Hybopsis biguttata</i> (Kirtland), which occurs
rarely in the Kansas River Basin. These partial similarities are coincidental,
because other characters of the hybrids make relationship
with <i>H. biguttata</i> implausible. The high number of gill rakers
(Table 3) and the length and position of the gut indicate strongly
that the three specimens are hybrids with <i>C. anomalum</i> as one
parent; the pharyngeal arches, though deformed, indicate that the
other parental species has two rows of teeth, with five teeth in the
main row. Only <i>S. atromaculatus</i>, among species in the Kansas
River Basin, usually has such a dental formula, and other characters
of our three specimens fit expectations in a hybrid between that
species and <i>C. a. plumbeum</i>.</p>

<p>Timber Creek, where the three hybrids were collected, is a small,
spring-fed, sandy-bottomed tributary to Scott County State Lake
in the extreme southwestern part of the Kansas River Basin. The
stream was less than 10 feet wide and six inches deep, except in
three pools near road crossings. The hybrids were found in two of
these pools, along with numerous <i>S. atromaculatus</i> and one adult
<i>C. a. plumbeum</i>.</p>

<p>Another specimen of <i>C. a. plumbeum</i> &times; <i>S. atromaculatus</i> (KU
4841, 39.3 mm. in standard length) was taken in the North Platte
River at Lisco, Garden County, Nebraska, on September 11, 1959.
That specimen has 7 anal rays and 52 scales in the lateral line; otherwise,
it is similar to the three hybrids described above.</p>

<p><b><i>Gila nigrescens</i> &times; <i>Rhinichthys cataractae</i></b>: KU 4253 (a male,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
60.6 mm. in standard length), from New Mexico, Bernalillo
County, Rio Grande 12 mi. S Bernalillo on U. S. Highway 85
(Corraleo Bridge). Compared in Table 4 with six specimens of
<i>G. nigrescens</i>: KU 4251, 4254, and 4262 (63.1-72.4 mm. in standard
length, mean 66.4 mm.); and with five specimens of <i>R. cataractae</i>:
KU 4248, 4258, and 4264 (55.6-65.0 mm. standard length, mean 59.5
mm.). Comparative material was taken at the same locality as
KU 4253 and at nearby localities in the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>The hybrid is intermediate in almost all of the features in which
the parental species differ from each other. For six of the characters
included in Table 4, the hybrid index is 49.7 per cent, when
<i>Gila</i> is assigned the value 0 (height of dorsal fin and numbers of fin
rays and teeth excluded). There is no enlargement of the head in
KU 4253, such as was found in <i>Gila orcutti</i> &times; <i>Siphateles mohavensis</i>
(Hubbs and Miller, 1943:373), <i>Chrosomus erythrogaster</i> &times; <i>Notropis
cornutus frontalis</i>, and <i>C. erythrogaster</i> &times; <i>Semotilus atromaculatus</i>.
The height of the dorsal fin, which Hubbs and Miller
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) found to be extreme in <i>G. orcutti</i> &times; <i>S. mohavensis</i>, exceeds
the average for the parental species in <i>G. nigrescens</i> &times; <i>R.
cataractae</i> also; but, dorsal fins as high as that of the hybrid were
found in some individuals of both parental species. In <i>R. cataractae</i>,
all fins are more rounded and more expansive than in <i>G. nigrescens</i>,
and fins other than the dorsal have an intermediate size in the hybrid.
This intermediacy has doubtful significance, because fin-size
in <i>Rhinichthys</i> varies greatly with body-size, sex, and probably with
the state of sexual development. <i>Rhinichthys</i> matures at smaller
size than <i>Gila</i>, and never becomes so large as that species.</p>

<p><i>Gila nigrescens</i> and <i>R. cataractae</i> differ strikingly in features
involving the snout and mouth, and these differences provide the
most conclusive evidence that KU 4253 is a hybrid of these species.
The projecting, fleshy snout of <i>R. cataractae</i> is bridged to the ventral
mouth by a frenum that is approximately 3 mm. wide in specimens
60 mm. in standard length. In <i>Gila</i>, the snout does not
project beyond the mouth, which is oblique, lacks a frenum, and
is larger than in <i>Rhinichthys</i>. The snout of the hybrid projects
less than in <i>R. cataractae</i> and is bridged to the upper lip by a
frenum 1.7 mm. wide. The mouth of the hybrid is intermediate
in size, obliquity, and thickness of the lips. <i>Rhinichthys</i> has
barbels, <i>Gila</i> lacks them, and the hybrid has one vestigial barbel,
on the right side. The lower surface of the head of <i>Rhinichthys</i> is
broad and flattened, with pronounced rugosity on the gular area
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and isthmus. In <i>Gila</i> the underside of the head is convex, with
comparatively smooth membranes; the hybrid is intermediate,
but tends toward <i>Gila</i>.</p>

The air bladder of KU 4253 is nearly as large as in <i>Gila</i>, and much
larger than the degenerate air bladder of <i>R. cataractae</i>. Although
the hybrid appears to be male, the gonads (especially the right
one) are poorly developed. The hybrid is intermediate in curvature
of the lateral line, which is nearly straight in <i>Rhinichthys</i> and
strongly decurved in <i>Gila</i>.</p>

<p>Specimen No. 4253 is mostly pallid, resembling <i>Gila</i> much more
than <i>Rhinichthys</i> in pigmentation. A mid-dorsal dark streak is
conspicuous in the hybrid, especially anteriorly, but is less intense
than in <i>Gila</i>. <i>Rhinichthys</i> lacks a well-developed dorsal stripe.
The preorbital and suborbital areas are more heavily pigmented
in the hybrid than in <i>Gila</i>, but not nearly so dark as in <i>Rhinichthys</i>.
The hybrid has a faint dark basicaudal spot that is variably developed
in <i>Rhinichthys</i> but absent in <i>Gila</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis venustus venustus</i> &times; <i>Notropis whipplei</i></b>: KU 3516 (a
male, 47.8 mm. in standard length), from Arkansas, Sevier Co.,
Winters Creek where it is crossed by U. S. Highway 71, 5 mi. N
of Little River Bridge, March 8, 1956. Compared in Table 5
with four specimens of <i>N. whipplei</i>, KU 3517 (45.0-52.6 mm. in
standard length, mean 50.6 mm.), same locality and date as KU
3516; four specimens of <i>N. v. venustus</i>, KU 3510 (44.5-49.6 mm.
in standard length, mean 47.3 mm.), Louisiana, Winn Parish,
Little Naches Bayou on U. S. Highway 71, 8.8 mi. NW Montgomery,
March 4, 1956; three specimens of <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> (Baird
and Girard) &times; <i>N. v. venustus</i>, KU 3510 (43.3-47.3 mm. in
stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ard
length, mean 44.7 mm.), same locality and date as <i>N. v. venustus</i>
above; and with tabulated data on <i>N. v. venustus</i> from Gibbs
(1957a:185-186). All specimens are from the lower Red River
Drainage; other series of <i>N. whipplei</i>, <i>N. venustus</i>, and <i>N. lutrensis</i>
&times; <i>N. venustus</i>, from the Red River Drainage and elsewhere, were
examined but are not tabulated because of differences in size,
and because of geographic variability that has been discussed by
Gibbs (1957a).</p>

<p>The Subgenus <i>Cyprinella</i> of <i>Notropis</i>, to which <i>N. venustus</i> and
<i>N. whipplei</i> belong, has been studied intensively by Gibbs (1957a
and b). <i>Notropis venustus</i> differs conspicuously from <i>N. whipplei</i>
in having a large dark basicaudal spot; also, <i>N. venustus</i> usually
has 8 (rather than 9) anal rays, and 15 (rather than 13) scales
above the lateral line immediately anterior to the dorsal fin. Specimens
of <i>N. v. venustus</i> from the Red River Drainage, where the
most robust representatives of the species are found, differ from
<i>N. whipplei</i> in depth of head, body, and caudal peduncle (Table
5).</p>

<p>KU 3516 has a composite of the 9-rayed anal fin of <i>N. whipplei</i>
and the caudal spot (albeit diffuse) of <i>N. venustus</i>; and, the hybrid
is intermediate in body-proportions that distinguish the two
species, especially depth of head, body, and caudal peduncle.
In other features KU 3516 has values within the overlapping
ranges of variation of <i>whipplei</i> and <i>venustus</i> except that the ratio
of postdorsal length to standard length is extremely long in the
hybrid, and the ratio of prepelvic length to standard length is
extremely short (Table 5). Both extreme values for the hybrid
seem to result from the cumulative influence of characters in
which the parental species differ slightly in mean value (especially
head-length, in which the hybrid is like <i>whipplei</i>, and caudal
peduncle-length, in which the hybrid approaches <i>venustus</i>, despite
the 9-rayed anal fin of the hybrid). The basicaudal spot of the
hybrid is like that of <i>N. v. venustus</i> except for being less intense.</p>

<p><i>Notropis venustus</i> hybridizes extensively with <i>N. lutrensis</i> (Hubbs,
Kuehne, and Ball, 1953:226-230; Hubbs and Strawn, 1956), and that
combination occurs in streams near the locality where KU 3516 was
taken. KU 3516 resembles <i>N. lutrensis</i> &times; <i>N. v. venustus</i> in many
ways, but is more slender than the latter hybrid. The depth of
head, body, and caudal peduncle are greater in <i>N. lutrensis</i> than in
<i>N. venustus</i> (much greater than in <i>N. whipplei</i>); therefore,
speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>mens
of <i>N. lutrensis</i> &times; <i>N. venustus</i> are usually deeper than <i>N.
venustus</i>, whereas KU 3516 is less deep. KU 3516 has a rather
sharp snout and thin, straight lips that are strongly suggestive of
<i>N. whipplei</i>, rather than <i>N. lutrensis</i>, in which the snout is rounded
and the lips are more obliquely decurved. There is less pigment
underlying the anterior lateral-line scales in KU 3516 than in <i>N.
lutrensis</i> &times; <i>N. venustus</i>, and melanophores on the scale-pockets of
KU 3516 are arranged in narrower, more distinct submarginal bars
than in <i>N. lutrensis</i> &times; <i>N. venustus</i>. Because of the difference in
pigmentation, the lateral scales of <i>N. whipplei</i> (and of KU 3516)
appear more narrowly diamond-shaped than the lateral scales of
<i>N. lutrensis</i> or <i>N. lutrensis</i> &times; <i>N. venustus</i>. The lengths and heights
of the scales are approximately the same in all three species.</p>

<p>Winters Creek, where KU 3516 was taken, flowed approximately
five cubic feet per second at the time our collection was made; a
landowner on the stream stated that it had been dry, except for
pools, in the previous two summers. The water was somewhat
gray, but nearly clear. The habitat consisted mainly of short riffles,
with average depth of four inches, and pools to depths of two feet.
Twelve species of fish, including <i>N. whipplei</i> but not <i>N. lutrensis</i>
or <i>N. venustus</i>, were found; other minnows were <i>Semotilus atromaculatus</i>,
<i>N. chalybaeus</i>, <i>N. cornutus</i>, <i>N. umbratilis</i>, and <i>Campostoma
anomalum</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
